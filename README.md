CaptionMe: A Neural Image Captioning System
Caption is an end-to-end deep learning system that automatically generates descriptive, human-like captions for images. This project leverages a sophisticated Encoder-Decoder architecture, combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to understand image features and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate natural language.
